### - âš¡ My history:
First of all, I love writing Code.

I'm part of the team ahead of Globo's video player library, present on multiple platforms: Android, iOS, Android TV, tvOS, Web, and Roku. It is most notably used by Globoplay, which is the Brazilian video streaming app with the largest number of subscribers.

The Player's ever-evolving plugin-based architecture provides a lot of opportunities to hone key software development skills and learn about video streaming's inner workings.
