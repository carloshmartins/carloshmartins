### - âš¡ My history:
First of all, I love writing Code. Ever since college when I taught myself iOS Development in Swift for my startup Idea. 
Before that, I had my first contact with Web Development, still in college, with Ruby on Rails when I was trying to create my first startup, it was an Airbnb for exchange students. And then I took a hiatus from technology and lived in Indonesia for 2 months to teach English for primary school students during my college vacation which it was arranged by AIESEC.

For my first professional full-time contact while in college, I was given the opportunity for a Jr. iOS Engineering at a small-size consulting company. During this time, I felt in love for the iOS community and started co-organizing CocoaHeads Meetup events at my local town.
My second contact was a mid-level position at a big size consultant company and I was responsible for maintaining one of the biggest app in the telecom industry in LATAM Market. It was basically creating new features and maintaining legacy code to newer versions, such as: converting Swift 3 to 5; creating new features on top of MVP App Architecture.

Nowadays, I work as an iOS Engineer at the biggest mediaTech company in LATAM called Globo. We have a responsibility of maintaining iOS modules shared with the entire company's main apps by using Cocoapods. Together with the team, we created the first open-source in-company GDPR Banner for iOS platform used by the entire company. Our new features have around +80% test coverage with XCTest. We created from the ground up our CI/CD pipeline entirely using GitLab CI and Fastlane.

Even when I leave my office, I tend to continue writing code in iOS and attend/co-organize Cocoaheads Meetups. I try to help other people's journey into iOS Development by opening pull request; sharing tips and experience. I had given some tech talk about: Mobile Scalability & best practices for generic modules.
